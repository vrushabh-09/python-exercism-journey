# To avoid the use of magic numbers (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)), you should define a PREPARATION_TIME constant.
# You can do that on the line below the 'EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME' constant.

    Parameters:

    Function that takes the number_of_layers you want to add to the lasagna as an argument and            returns how many minutes you would spend making them. Assume each layer takes 2 minutes to            prepare.
